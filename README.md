FCDS Internal Training - Internet of Things: Theory and Applications

## Description
During the Summer Term 2023, we attended the internal training at the Faculty of Computing and Data Science, titled "Internet of Things: Theory and Applications." The training was instructed by Eng. Mohamed Hatem, Eng. Mohamed Wael, and Eng. Menna Ashraf.<br>
The subjects of this training were:
- Module 1: C++ Programming (Session 1, 2)
- Module 2: ESP32 Based IoT Systems (Session 2, 3, 4)
- Module 3: Cloud Databases using Firebase (Session 5, 6)
- Module 4: GUI using Flutter/Web Apps (Session 6, 7)
- Module 5: Basics of Networks & IoT Security (Bonus) (Session 8)

In this repository, we saved the codes for the sessions' practice questions, the assignments, and the final project.

## Final Project
For our final project, we built an Arduino-based mechanical ventilator that simulates volume-control ventilation. For more information, visit the [Final Project](/Final%20Project/) sub-repository.
